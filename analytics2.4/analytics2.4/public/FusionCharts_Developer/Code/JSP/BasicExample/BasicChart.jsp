	/*
	This page demonstrates the ease of generating charts using FusionCharts.
	For this chart, we've used a pre-defined Data.xml (contained in /Data/ folder)
	Ideally, you would NOT use a physical data file. Instead you'll have 
	your own JSP to create the XML data document. Such examples are also present.
	For a head-start, we've kept this example very simple.
