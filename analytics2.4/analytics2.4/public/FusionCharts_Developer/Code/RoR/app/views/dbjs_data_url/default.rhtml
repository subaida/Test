	'The entire app (page) can be summarized as under. This app shows the break-down
	'of factory wise output generated. In a pie chart, we first show the sum of quantity
	'generated by each factory. These pie slices, when clicked would show detailed date-wise
	'output of that factory. The detailed data would be dynamically pulled by the column
	'chart from another Rails page. There are no page refreshes required. Everything
	'is done on one single page.
	
	'The XML data for the pie chart is fully created in Rails at run-time. Rails interacts
	'with the database and creates the XML for this.
	'Now, for the column chart (date-wise output report), each time we need the data
	'we dynamically submit request to the server with the appropriate factoryId. The server
	'responds with an XML document, which we accept and update chart at client side.
