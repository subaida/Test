              <span class="sub_title">Liability/Warranties/Indemnification</span>
              <ol>
                <li>You shall indemnify Mobile-Worx with respect to all  liability, losses, damages, costs or expenses howsoever caused, arising out of,  or in connection with a breach of your obligations under this Agreement.</li>
                <li>You acknowledge that you are using the service at  your own risk. The Service is provided &quot;as is&quot;, and Mobile-Worx and  its affiliates hereby expressly disclaim any and all warranties, express and  implied, including but not limited to any warranties of accuracy, reliability,  title, merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose or  any other warranty, condition, guarantee or representation, whether oral, in  writing or in electronic form, including but not limited to the accuracy or  completeness of any information contained therein or provided by the service. Mobile-Worx,  its affiliates and its third party service providers do not represent or  warrant that access to the Service will be uninterrupted or that there will be  no failures, errors or omissions or loss of transmitted information, or that no  viruses will be transmitted on the Service.</li>
                <li>No advice or information, whether oral or written,  obtained by you from Mobile-Worx through or from the Service shall create any  warranty not expressly stated in this Agreement.</li>
                <li>Mobile-Worx and its affiliates and third party  service providers shall not be liable to Publisher or to any third parties for  any direct, indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages allegedly  sustained arising out of this Agreement, the providing of services hereunder,  the sale or purchase of any goods or merchandise, Publisher's access to or  inability to access the Service, including for viruses alleged to have been  obtained from the Service, your use of or reliance on the Service or any of the  merchandise, information or materials available on the Service, regardless of  the type of claim or the nature of the cause of action, even if advised of the possibility  of such damages. Each party acknowledges that the other party has entered into  this Agreement relying on the limitations of liability stated herein and that  those limitations are an essential basis of the bargain between the parties.</li>
                <li>You hereby agree to release Mobile-Worx, its  affiliates and third-party service providers, and each of their respective  directors, officers, employees, and agents from claims, demands and damages  (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected  and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed (&quot;claims&quot;), arising out of  or in any way connected with your use of the service.</li>

If Advertiser is a California resident, Advertiser waives  California civil code section 1542, which states, in part: &quot;a general  release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect  to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by  him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor&quot;.</li>
                <li>The aggregate liability for Mobile-Worx to Publisher  for all claims arising from the use of the Service is limited to the net  proceeds to Mobile-Worx from the Advertising sales Publisher's AD Spaces  generated during the previous calendar month.</li>
                <li>Mobile-Worx is not responsible for the content of the  Advertisements managed under the Service. Mobile-Worx does not review  Advertisements before they are displayed, and does not verify, endorse, or  otherwise take responsibility for the contents of any Advertisements. Mobile-Worx  reserves the right to remove from its servers any Advertisement or Publisher  Content which it determines to be in violation of its rules and guidelines. Mobile-Worx  is not responsible for any malware or other unauthorized code included as part  of the marketing collateral associated with advertising campaigns. Mobile-Worx  reserves the right to immediately suspend any advertising campaign that  contains such malware or unauthorized code.</li>
                <li>You are responsible for all usage or activity on your  account management tools, including use of the account by any third party  authorized by you to use your user name and password. You are advised to  maintain the confidentiality of your account management password. You are  responsible for ensuring that you exit from your account at the end of each  session. If you are a Publisher, you are solely responsible for the usage and  placement of AD Spaces on your Web Site(s).</li>
                </ol>

                <li>If Mobile-Worx terminates the Agreement, it will send  an email to you if you have supplied a valid address on the relevant  registration form. If you have not supplied a currently valid email, Mobile-Worx  may terminate this Agreement without any notice.</li>
