                  <strong>What Personal Information Does Company Collect?</strong><br />
                  <br />
                  We collect the following types of personal information from our users:<br />
                  <br />
                  <span class="sub_title">A) Information You Provide to Us<br />
                    </span>We receive and store personal information you choose to enter on the Site, or   provide us in any other way, such as by telephone or by electronic mail. For   example, when you register for our services, we collect personal information   about you. This information may include your name, address, e-mail address,   telephone number, and credit card number. We may combine the information we   collect from you with information about you that we receive from other online   and offline sources, such as from our merchant partners, in order to provide you   with a better experience and to improve the quality of the Company services. For   certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of our combining of   such information. In addition, if you voluntarily complete a detailed publisher   or advertiser questionnaire, we collect personal information about you. This   information may include your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone   number, as well as general information about your business. In general, the more   information you feel comfortable giving us, the more we can customize the Site   and Company services to meet your needs.<br />
                  <br />
                  <span class="sub_title">B) Automatic Information<br />
                    </span>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard   drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser   and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and by how many   people. Our cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine   information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us   who you are or what your screen name or email address is. The &quot;help&quot; portion of   the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your   browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when   you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend   that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to   take advantage of some of the Site's most attractive features.<br />
                  <br />
                  We   automatically receive and store certain other types of information whenever you   interact with us. For example, our servers track the type of Web browser you are   using, where you travel within the Site, and the page to which you link from the   Site. If you are a publisher using Company's services, Company may access,   index, and cache requests made from your mobile sites, applications and device   platforms to our system, including by automated means. Generally, our service   automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of   visitors to the Site and its components. This data is only used in the   aggregate. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often   customers use parts of the Site, so we can make the Site and Company services   appealing to as many customers as possible.<br />
                  <br />
                  Many companies offer programs   that help you to visit Websites anonymously. While Company will not be able to   provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want   you to be aware that these programs are available<br />
                  <br />
                  When your customers   connect to the Company services on their mobile device, if their mobile phone   service provider uniquely identifies the device, Company will receive this   information. Company may use this unique mobile device identification   information to offer these customers extended services and/or functionality.   Certain Company services may require our collection from your customers of the   phone number, and/or other unique identifiers, for their device. We may   associate that phone number to the mobile device identification information and   to other information we have collected from and about these customers; however   we will not use that number for telemarketing. Some mobile phone service   providers are required to operate a system that will record the physical   location of devices that use their service. Depending on the mobile phone   service provider, Company may automatically receive this information.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How Does Company Use the Personal Information it Receives?</strong><br />

                  In addition, as noted above, we use the information we collect to better   understand what products and services are of interest to our users. To this end,   we may use personally identifiable information in an aggregate form to gain a   broader perspective of what preferences our users have, and to measure interest   in the various areas of the Site.<br />
